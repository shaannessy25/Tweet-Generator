Tell me why you hate me (yeah)
Tell me why you cry
Tell me why you love me (yeah)
Why you even try
I know why you stay here
You’ve been fiending 
You pull on me with that high beam
I know you came to ride me so exciting
Ive been meaning 
To tell you that you bad as fuck
But I can’t go cuff you up nah
I came too far to let you know
Its hard to let it go 
Never been one to say I’m strong on my own
Its hard to let it go hard to let it show
Maybe I’m the one to say I’m fine all alone
Now I’m in the city getting litty 
Hit me when you miss me
Bitch I’m tipsy hit a quickie 
Wit some biddies please forgive me
Then go lift me up again 
And no we can’t pretend that  
That we can be some friends in the end
I just wanna be a king, I’ll take the pain it brings
That’s all I really need, I aiming for the peace  
I just wanna  be a king, I’ll take the pain it brings
It might hard to reach that’s why they call it dreams
Stuck in hypnosis I’m getting psychosis
The path that I’ve chosen I might end up broken  
I’ve been losing focus, I hope they don’t  notice 
Becoming so hopeless the way I’ve been coping
It’s the same club, same cup same drank Im poured up
I got the same dank, same bud, got woods let’s roll up
The government control us that’s why we goin’ scroll up
That’s why they patrol us these robots show no love 
I spoke change, ain’t done  a thang
Played the game, became a lame
Copped a chain, remained the same
Spoke change, ain’t changed a thang
But I gotta go and get it 
Gotta go make a difference
Gotta go a set the limit so gotta do a different
Gotta do it for the children that can’t build none
Struggle the bills son shit get real son
You wanna get the money but can’t get none
You wanna get the money but you can’t funds
So you struggle with the hustle but you never gonna settle for the medal 
with a bezzle up yo level push the pedal
I just wanna be a king, I’ll take the pain it brings
That’s all I really need, I aiming for the peace  
I just wanna  be a king, I’ll take the pain it brings
It might hard to reach that’s why they call it dreams

Never beat this shit and before I quit I’ll buy my coffin 
Sad truth is that I’ll end up all alone
The saddest fucking truth is that I did this on my own
I know I’m on this road and I’ll be stuck up in this zone
Until the day i fucking drop just leave my body and my soul
In the dirt for what is really worth 
Just know I did my best, but I just left it in a mess
When it’s time I’ll cop my nine
And bust nine shots right out my chest
And maybe then I can get little rest
I see the signs of my decline and in my mind I ain’t alright 
I need to fight, but have no might I pray I die and see the light
I lost my friends I lost my fam I lost the one that was divine 
I lost everything I ever truly loved in my life
Why do I even do this to the people show me love
I am evil menace but I’m coming from above
I tried to make it right, but it just end up in a fight
I guess I ain’t the guy and all the stress you can’t deny
